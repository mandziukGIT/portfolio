I played a key role in developing a tool enabling users to compare ring offers from different producers. Leveraging this experience, I collaborated with the team to craft an e-commerce platform for customizable jewelry. Finally, I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to the development of Auroria's large-scale online store, including critical components like the warehouse management system.",
